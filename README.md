# Python Spending Analyzer
This project, which remains a work in progress, shows how to use Python to (1) aggregate and code personal financial statements (e.g. from credit and debit cards), and (2) analyze spending on a monthly and annual basis. 

Note that the financial data used in this program is simulated.
